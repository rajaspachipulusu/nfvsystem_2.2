StEPS to BRING UP SEEDVM AND CONFIGURATION
##########################################

Login to the seedhost with nfvadmin user and perform the following 

1. Copy the NFV Seed VM image (.qcow2), the script nfvsys_seedhost_prereq.sh and the debian 'nfv-seedvm-netconfig' from nfvbits server to the following location of the Seed Host

    /home/nfvadmin

The locations are as follows on nfvbits

/var/www/build/nfvsystem/17.03/images/seedqcow2/NFVSYS-NFVSEEDVM-001.qcow2
/data/nfvbits/nfvsystem/17.03/Integration/Jan03/nfv-seedvm-netconfig_17.03.0-4_amd64.deb
/var/www/build/nfvsystem/17.03/images/scripts/nfvsys_seedhost_prereq.sh



2) Copy the NFV Seed VM image (.qcow2 ) to  /var/lib/libvirt/images   from /home/nfvadmin


   sudo cp NFVSYS-NFVSEEDVM-001.qcow2  /var/lib/libvirt/images/


3) Run the script as below to deploy the seedvm 


   sudo sh nfvsys_seedhost_prereq.sh


The script brings up the seedvm and the private IP address is assigned to the seedvm and the IP address is displayed at the end of the script output.


4) scp 'nfv-seedvm-netconfig' the debian copied  to the seedvm from seedhost.


scp nfv-seedvm-netconfig  nfvadmin@<private IP ADDRESS of the seedvm>:


5) ssh to the seedvm with nfvadmin user and the credentials are available in the CID


6) Install the debian on the seedvm


   sudo dpkg -i nfv-seedvm-netconfig.....deb


 
Ensure json files are created in the appropriate location before proceeding further.

7) Go to the folder  /depot/hpe_nfvsystem/common/tools/scripts/nfvseedhost/nfvseedhost_rh/


cd /depot/hpe_nfvsystem/common/tools/scripts/nfvseedhost/nfvseedhost_rh/

Then run the playbook using the below command.

ansible-playbook hpe_nfvsys_seedhost_configure.yml

Which will bring up the all the networks like br-nfv-pxe, br-bls, br-oam, br-ncp  on the seedhost. However the gateways of these networks are not pingable at this stage. These networks are reachable once the switch automation is completed.

8) Go the folder /depot/hpe_nfvsystem/common/tools/scripts/nfvseedhost/nfvseedvm_rh/

cd /depot/hpe_nfvsystem/common/tools/scripts/nfvseedhost/nfvseedvm_rh/

ansible-playbook hpe_nfvsystem_seedvm_config.yml

9) Proceed for the switch automation.
