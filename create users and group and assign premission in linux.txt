
Sudo Configuration for KVM Nodes.
----------------------------------

Defaults        env_reset,timestamp_timeout=0  --> which will ask the password everytime we run the command preceded with sudo.

a) Cmnd_Alias OPENSAFCMDS = /etc/init.d/opensafd, /usr/bin/kvmha *, /usr/bin/virsh list *,

a) create a group called 'admin'  and kvmadmin add users to both the groups  which can run any commands on the host.


%admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL
%kvmadmin ALL = OPENSAFCMDS


1) add user gtk to the group sudo 

sudo usermod -aG sudo gtk


a) Eliminate NOPASSWD option. NOPASSWD  gives an option to run the eligible commands without prompting 

for any password. Not a  best option. Applies to all systems except seedvm

But NOPASSWD should be required in the seedvm for the playbooks to run non-interactively.
